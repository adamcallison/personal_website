My current research is focused on gate-based quantum algorithms for classical optimization problems. Prior to this, I did my PhD between Imperial College London and Durham University, working on continuous-time quantum algorithms for classical optimization problems. I am a keen programmer and, as my research tends to be computational in nature, my main research tool is the Python language. This includes many useful libraries, such as NumPy, SciPy, pandas and matplotlib.</p>"},{"location":"#python","title":"Python","text":"<p>Computer Science Problems An in-progress repo in which I am completing the exercises from David Kopec's Classic Computer Science Problems in Python</p> <p>QAOAtools A work-in-progress set of tools for simulating the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm at an abstract level</p> <p>QAE2 A work-in-progress set of tools for simulating the Maximum-Likelihood Quantum Amplitudes Estimation at an abstract level</p> <p>More My GitHub is available at https://github.com/adamcallison</p>"},{"location":"#academic-publications","title":"Academic Publications","text":"<p>I have a number of academic publications.
