I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in the field of Quantum Computing at University College London.
My current research is focused on gate-based quantum algorithms for classical optimization problems.
Prior to this, I did my PhD between Imperial College London and Durham University, working on continuous-time quantum algorithms for classical optimization problems.
I am a keen programmer and, as my research tends to be computational in nature, my main research tool is the **Python** language.
This includes many useful libraries, such as *NumPy*, *SciPy*, *pandas* and *matplotlib*.

## **Python**
[Computer Science Problems](https://github.com/adamcallison/ComputerScienceProblems)  
An in-progress repo in which I am completing the exercises from David Kopec's *Classic Computer Science Problems in Python*.
I am using this to improve my general programming skills and my use of pytest

[QAOAtools](https://github.com/adamcallison/qaoatools)  
A work-in-progress set of tools for simulating the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm at an abstract level

[QAE2](https://github.com/adamcallison/qae2)  
A work-in-progress set of tools for simulating the Maximum-Likelihood Quantum Amplitudes Estimation at an abstract level (now with some circuit-based simulation tools implemented via Qiskit)

[CCPCrys](https://github.com/adamcallison/ccpcrys)
An in-progress repo for building a quantum annealing problem Hamiltonian for a new approach to the phasing problem in macromolecular crystallography that I am currently researching.
